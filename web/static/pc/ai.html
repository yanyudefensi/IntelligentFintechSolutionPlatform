              <!--这个右边的介绍内容-->
              <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent
                machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence
                are designed for include:</p>
              <p> • Speech recognition </p>
              <p> • Learning </p>
              <p> • Planning </p>
              <p> • Problem solving </p>
              <h3 id="section2">Explanations of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
              <p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent
                machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized.
                The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as:
                • Knowledge
                • Reasoning
                • Problem solving
                • Perception
                • Learning
                • Planning
                • Ability to manipulate and move objects
                <p>
                  Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans
                  only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access
                  to objects,
                  categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering.
                  Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious
                  task.</p>
                <p>Machine learning is also a core part of AI. Learning without any kind of supervision requires an
                  ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves
                  classification and numerical regressions. Classification determines the category an object belongs to
                  and regression deals with obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples, thereby discovering
                  functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs. Mathematical analysis of
                  machine learning algorithms
                  and their performance is a well-defined branch of theoretical computer science often referred to as
                  computational learning theory.
                </p>
                <p>Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of
                  the world,
                  while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few sub-problems such as facial,
                  object and gesture recognition.</p>
                <p>Robotics is also a major field related to AI. Robots require intelligence to handle tasks such
                  as object manipulation and navigation, along with sub-problems of localization, motion planning and
                  mapping.</p>

                <h3 id="section3">Approaches</h3>
                <p>There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research.
                  Researchers disagree about many issues.A few of the most long standing questions that
                  have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence
                  by studying psychology or neurobiology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird
                  biology is to aeronautical engineering? Can intelligent behavior be described using simple,
                  elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a
                  large number of completely unrelated problems?</p>
                <h5>Cybernetics and brain simulation</h5>
                <p>In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurobiology,
                  information theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines used electronic networks to
                  exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast.
                  Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University
                  and the Ratio Club in England. By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it
                  would be revived in the 1980s.
                </p>
                <h5>Symbolic</h5>
                <p>When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore
                  the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was
                  centered in three institutions: Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford and MIT, and as described below,
                  each one developed its own style of research. John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI
                  "good old fashioned AI" or "GOFAI". During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great
                  success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on
                  cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.
                  Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually
                  succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of
                  their field.
                </p>
                <h5>Cognitive simulation</h5>
                <p>Economist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to
                  formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well
                  as cognitive science, operations research and management science. Their research team used the results
                  of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to
                  solve problems. This tradition,
                  centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar
                  architecture in the middle 1980s.</p>

                <h5>Logic-based</h5>
                <p>Unlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought,
                  but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless
                  whether people used the same algorithms. His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal
                  logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.
                  Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh
                  and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the
                  science of logic programming.</p>
                <h5>Anti-logic or scruffy</h5>
                <p>Researchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert) found that solving difficult problems
                  in vision and natural language processingrequired ad-hoc solutions—they argued that there was no
                  simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior.
                  Roger Schank described their "anti-logic" approaches as "scruffy" (as opposed to the "neat"
                  paradigms at CMU and Stanford).Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat's Cyc) are an
                  example of "scruffy" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.</p>
