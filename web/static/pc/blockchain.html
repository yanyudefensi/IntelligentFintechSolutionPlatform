              <h3 id="section1">Definition - What does Blockchain mean?</h3>
              <!--这个右边的介绍内容-->
              <p>A blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, which
                are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6]
                a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). </p>
              <h3 id="section2">Explanation of Blockchain</h3>
              <p>The blockchain ledger helps to provide transparency for transactions. Although many bitcoin
                transactions are in some ways anonymous, the blockchain ledger can link individuals and companies to
                bitcoin purchases and ownership by allowing individual parties, called miners, to process payments and
                verify transactions. Rather than a central company presiding over the use of bitcoin, these blockchain
                originators serve central roles in the management and administration of this alternative currency
                system. </p>
              <h2 id="section3">Structure</h2>
              <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record
                transactions across many computers so that any involved recordcannot be altered retroactively, without
                the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[1][18] This allows the participants to verify and audit
                transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[19] A blockchain database is managed
                autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated
                by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[20] Such a design facilitates robust
                workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain
                removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit
                of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain
                has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] A blockchain can maintain title rights because,
                when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and
                acceptance.</p>
              <h2 id="section4">Blocks</h2>
              <p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[1] Each block
                includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks
                form a chain.[1] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back
                to the original genesis block.[22]
                Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a
                secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of
                the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for
                inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[22] Peers supporting the database have different
                versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database
                known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single
                new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their
                peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of
                the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and
                are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the
                probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[23] as more blocks are built on top
                of it, eventually becoming very low.[1][24]:ch. 08[25] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system,
                where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There
                are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a
                blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and
                parallel manner.[26]
              </p>
              <h3 id="section4">Block time</h3>
              <p>The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the
                blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.[27] By the time of
                block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the
                transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum
                is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.[28]
              </p>
              <h3 id="section4">Hard forks</h3>
              <p>This section is transcluded from Fork (blockchain). (edit | history)
                A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the
                blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work
                in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software.
                If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software, a
                split can occur. For example, Ethereum has hard-forked to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which
                had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split
                creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard
                fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of
                50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of
                the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent
                split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of
                bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[29]

              </p>
              <h2 id="section5">Decentralization</h2>
              <p>By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come
                with data being held centrally.[1] The decentralized blockchain may use ad-hoc message passing and
                distributed networking.
                Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can
                exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of
                public-key cryptography.[4]:5 A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on
                the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A
                private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to
                otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the
                blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[1]
                Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive
                database replication[8] and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is
                "trusted" more than any other.[4] Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are
                delivered on a best-effort basis. Mining nodes validate transactions,[22] add them to the block they are
                building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[24]:ch. 08 Blockchains use various
                time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[30] Alternative consensus methods
                include proof-of-stake.[22] Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of
                centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more
                expensive.[31]
              </p>
              <h3 id="section6">Openness</h3>
              <p>Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to
                the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless,
                controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a
                private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be
                considered a blockchain.[32][33][34][35][36] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the
                term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These
                blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[37]
                Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database,
                blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a
                blockchain.[38]:30–31Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases,
                not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator
                tampering and revision.[32][34] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house blockchain
                solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model,
                proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."[10][39]
              </p>
              <h4 id="section6">Permissionless</h4>
              <p>The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against
                bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[23] This means that applications can be
                added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport
                layer.[23]
                Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include
                a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed
                in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli
                Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".
                Financial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.[40] In 2016, venture capital
                investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[41] Bitcoin
                and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest
                market capitalization.

              </p>
              <h4 id="section6">Permissioned (private) blockchain</h4>
              <p>See also: Distributed ledger
                Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[42] In
                contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the
                network owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the
                network effect.[43][better source needed] Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of
                'consortium' blockchains.[44]
                The New York Times noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks
                "with private blockchains, independent of the public system."[45][46][better source needed]

              </p>
              <h4 id="section6">Disadvantages of private blockchain</h4>
              <p>Nikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a
                private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block
                creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate
                server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you
                wished."[10] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or
                debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions
                that favor some groups at the expense of others,[47][48] and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the
                massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using
                gigawatts of computing power — it's time consuming and expensive."[10] He also said, "Within a private
                blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster
                than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than
                cumbersome databases."[10]
