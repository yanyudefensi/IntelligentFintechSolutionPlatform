              <h3 id="section1">Definition - What does Cloud Computing mean?</h3>
              <!--这个右边的介绍内容-->
              <p>Cloud computing is the use of various services, such as software development platforms, servers,
                storage and software, over the internet, often referred to as the "cloud." In general, there are three
                cloud computing characteristics that are common among all cloud-computing vendors: </p>
              <p>1. The back-end of the application (especially hardware) is completely managed by a cloud vendor. </p>
              <p>2. A user only pays for services used (memory, processing time and bandwidth, etc.). </p>
              <p>3. Services are scalable Many cloud computing advancements are closely related to virtualization. The
                ability to pay on demand and scale quickly is largely a result of cloud computing vendors being able to
                pool resources that may be divided among multiple clients. It is common to categorize cloud computing
                services as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software as a service
                (SaaS). </p>
              <h3 id="section2">Explanation of Cloud Computing</h3>
              <p>Some consider cloud computing an overused buzzword that has been blown out of proportion by marketing
                departments at large software firms. A common argument from critics is that cloud computing cannot
                succeed because it means that organizations must lose control of their data, such as an email provider
                that stores data in multiple locations around the world. A large regulated company, like a bank, might
                be required to store data in the United States. While this is not an insurmountable issue, it
                demonstrates the type of issue that some companies may have with cloud computing. Cloud computing
                proponents point to it being a new paradigm in software development, where smaller organizations have
                access to processing power, storage and business processes that were once only available to large
                enterprises. The name cloud computing comes from the traditional usage of the cloud to represent the
                internet – or a wide area network (WAN) – in network diagrams or flowcharts. </p>

              <h2 id="section3">Service models</h2>
              <div align="center"><img style="height: 350px;width: 600px" src="img/111.png" /></div>
              <p>Though service-oriented architecture advocates "everything as a service" (with the acronyms EaaS or
                XaaS,[61] or simply aas), cloud-computing providers offer their "services" according to different
                models, of which the three standard models per NIST are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as
                a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).[60] These models offer increasing abstraction; they
                are thus often portrayed as a layers in a stack: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service,
                but these need not be related. For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare
                metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and
                access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS.</p>
              <h3 id="section3">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h3>

              <p>Main article: Infrastructure as a service
                "Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to
                dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing
                resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor runs the virtual
                machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers
                of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying
                requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on
                the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to
                isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than
                virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales
                dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables
                usage-based billing.[62] IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine
                disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses,
                virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.[63]
                The NIST's definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as "where the consumer is able to deploy and run
                arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage
                or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and
                deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host
                firewalls)."[60]
                IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in
                data centers. For wide-area connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds
                (dedicated virtual private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system
                images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches
                and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS
                services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and
                consumed.[citation needed]
              </p>
              <h3 id="section3">Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>

              <p>Main article: Platform as a service
                The NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:[60]
                The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or
                acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by
                the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including
                network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and
                possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
                PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops
                toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models,
                cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including operating system, programming-language
                execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their
                software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the
                underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud
                Platform and Google App Engine, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to
                match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter
                has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments.[64][need
                quotation to verify]
                Some integration and data management providers have also embraced specialized applications of PaaS as
                delivery models for data solutions. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS
                (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration
                flows.[65] Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of
                integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.[66] dPaaS delivers
                integration—and data-management—products as a fully managed service.[67] Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS
                provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of data solutions by building tailored
                data applications for the customer. dPaaS users retain transparency and control over data through
                data-visualization tools.[68] Platform as a Service (PaaS) consumers do not manage or control the
                underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but have
                control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting
                environment.

              </p>
              <h3 id="section3">Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>

              <p>Main article: Software as a service
                The NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:[60]
                The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud
                infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client
                interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not
                manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems,
                storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited
                user-specific application configuration settings.
                In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases.
                Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes
                referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription
                fee.[69] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and
                cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure
                and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on
                the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from
                other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual
                machines at run-time to meet changing work demand.[70] Load balancersdistribute the work over the set of
                virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access-point. To
                accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be multitenant, meaning that any
                machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization.
                The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user,[71] so
                prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point.[72] Proponents claim
                that SaaS gives a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and
                software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT
                operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other
                goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for
                users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud
                provider's server. As a result,[citation needed] there could be unauthorized access to the
                data.[citation needed]

              <h3 id="section3">Mobile "backend" as a service (MBaaS)</h3>

              <p>Main article: Mobile backend as a service
                In the mobile "backend" as a service (m) model, also known as backend as a service (BaaS), web app and
                mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud
                computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and
                custom software development kits (SDKs). Services include user management, push notifications,
                integration with social networking services[73] and more. This is a relatively recent model in cloud
                computing,[74] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later[75][76][77] but trends indicate that
                these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers.[78]

              </p>
              <h3 id="section4">Serverless computing</h3>

              <p>Main article: Serverless computing
                Serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages
                starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an
                abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per
                hour.[79] Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers.[79] Serverless
                computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase,
                rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.

              </p>
              <h3 id="section3">Function as a service (FaaS)</h3>

              <p>Main article: Function as a service
                Function as a service (FaaS) is a service-hosted remote procedure call that leverages serverless
                computing to enable the deployment of individual functions in the cloud that run in response to
                events.[80] FaaS is included under the broader term serverless computing, but the terms may also be used
                interchangeably.[81]

              <h3 id="section4">Private cloud</h3>

              <p>Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed
                internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.[60]Undertaking a private
                cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the
                organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step
                in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities.
                Self-run data centers[82] are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint,
                requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed
                periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users
                "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,[83]
                essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing
                concept".[84][85]


              </p>
              <h3 id="section4">Public cloud</h3>

              <p>A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for
                public use. Public cloud services may be free.[86]Technically there may be little or no difference
                between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially
                different for services (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by a service
                provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally,
                public cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, Microsoft and Google own and
                operate the infrastructure at their data center and access is generally via the Internet. AWS, Oracle,
                Microsoft, and Google also offer direct connect services called "AWS Direct Connect", "Oracle
                FastConnect", "Azure ExpressRoute", and "Cloud Interconnect" respectively, such connections require
                customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud
                provider.[44][87]

              </p>
              <h3 id="section4">Hybrid cloud</h3>

              <p>Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct
                entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can
                also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud
                resources.[60] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of
                some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.[88]
                A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one
                category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or
                the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud
                service.
                Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive
                client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business
                intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.[89] This example of hybrid
                cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the
                addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of
                factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the
                applications an organization uses.[90]
                Another example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to
                meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.[91] This capability enables
                hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.[60] Cloud bursting is an application
                deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and "bursts" to a public
                cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a
                hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are
                needed.[92] Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports
                average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing
                demands.[93] The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is
                called "Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud". A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU
                architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. Users can transparently deploy and scale
                applications without knowledge of the cloud's hardware diversity.[94] This kind of cloud emerges from
                the rise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.
